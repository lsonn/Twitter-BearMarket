# Twitter-BearMarket
The goal is to observe the tweets intensity of selected cryptocurrencies hashtags in a week of high prices volatility. (i.e., LUNA and UST crash)
We also want to measure the community engagement behind each crypto project by the tweet intensity normalized by the average Market Capitalization over the period.

It is not advanced data analysis, just playing with the data to get some insights! 

Cheers, Lucas
